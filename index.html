    <h2 class="hidden">About</h2>
 	<p class="text_column">In May of 2020 I will be completing my time at Chapman University, graduating with honors with 2 degrees: B.S. Computer Science and B.A. Psychology. I began programming 8 years ago in high school by learning text-based game development in Python. I immediately felt intoxicated by the puzzle-solving challenge that is programming and honed my skills in thinking upside-down and backwards. Since then, my passion for programming and technology has only grown as I have continued to diversify my technical skills ranging from front-end web design to back-end database management.</p>
  	<p class="text_column">My interest in Psychology was born out of a desire to understand why humans think and behave in seeemingly unpredictable ways. Through this experience, I have learned to became a more effective communicator and learned the "people skills" necessary to succeed in any professional/social domain. Moreover, I conducted a literature review focused on empathy in virtual humans designed for psychotherapy. This project proved to be the perfect intersection of human behavior and computer science.</p>
    <p class="text_column">Overall, I am a self-motivated individual who pays great attention to detail and am able to communicate clearly through both written and spoken word. When given a task, I excel in creating a specific goal and a plan of action necessary to complete that goal. I am extremely adaptable both when unexpected events occur and when integrating myself into a team. My search for a career has been motivated by my drive to learn new things, my breadth of knowledge and technical skills,  as well as my passion for the betterment and creation of technology.</p>
